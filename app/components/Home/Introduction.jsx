        I'm an e-commerce enthusiast with a passion for problem-solving
        (Enneagram Type 5) and a knack for clear communication and adaptability
        (Gemini). My analytical mind (INTJ) thrives on tackling technical
        challenges, and I leverage my interpersonal skills to deliver exceptional
        customer service. My journey at Shopify began as a Junior Support
        Advisor, and through perseverance and a thirst for knowledge, I've
        progressed to become a Plus Support Specialist. (Replace with your story)
